# App contract

The contract is the set of rules between the editor and an app. `APP_API` in `lib/contracts.mjs` holds its version. An app in the store says which version it is written to in its `api` field.

## Contract 3: `@app/self`

Contract 3 adds one module. An app file can import the id of its own folder.

```ts
import self from '@app/self';

self.id; // 'app_a030dfba69793996'
```

- `self.id` is the folder name under `src/apps/`. Apps from the store have a store id such as `app_a030dfba69793996`. An app a site made itself, and an older store copy, keep a plain name such as `cookiescanner` or `mobilepay`.
- Use `self.id` where the app needs its own id. Do not write the folder name in the code.
- Only files under `src/apps/<id>/` can import `@app/self`. Any other file fails the build with `@app/self is only for app files: <path>`.
- The Vite plugin is `appSelf` in `site/appSelf.mjs`. The types are in `src/virtual.d.ts`.

## Contract 2

Apps written to contract 2 build and run as before. Contract 3 only adds `@app/self`.
