# @morphemecms/cms

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 545e832: Themes and apps are installed from the Morpheme store, through the site's Worker (`/api/store/`); set the secret `MORPHEME_STORE_KEY` to connect a site. `store` in `src/site/config.ts` is gone, and a store theme may import CSS only from `@morphemecms/cms` and its own files.
- 9dbb555: Builds on Windows: the theme's helpers `ui/dialog.ts`, `ui/bottomSheet.ts` and `ui/sideSheet.ts` are now `ui/dialogControl.ts`, `ui/bottomSheetControl.ts` and `ui/sideSheetControl.ts` (app API 2, theme API 3), the editor's screen data modules are `*Data.ts`, `worker/apps.js` with CRLF line endings passes the content check, and the check stops two files whose names differ only by case.

### Patch Changes

- 13d68c5: The package now includes its CHANGELOG.md, so a site can read what each version changed.
